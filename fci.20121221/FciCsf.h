// This implements the genealogical coupling scheme for generating the expansion
// of spin eigenfunctions (for configuration state functions) in terms of
// determinants. See purple book p. 54ff.
//
// Return values:
//    - pCsfCoeffs: nDets x nCsf matrix.
//    - nDets, nCsfs: number of determinants and csfs (respectively) for nOpen
//      orbitals and given S/M quantum numbers.
//    - pDetPat: determinant patterns nDets refers to. Each one is understood
//      as a vector of length nOpen, with bit #i indicating that open-shell
//      orbital #i is alpha. All open orbitals which are not alpha are beta.
// Note on inputs:
//    - If AbsorbSignsForStringOrder is given, additional signs are absorbed
//      into the CSFs with the assumption that instead of the default ordering,
//      where the spatial orbital order is fixed and alpha/beta varies,
//      we first have all alpha orbitals and then all beta orbitals, with the
//      spatial orbital order varying. The latter scheme is convenient in string
//      determinant methods.
//
// Note: Output data is allocated on Mem. pCsfCoeffs may not be the first
//       allocation on Mem! So keep base pointers separately.
